test_1 - test dataRetrieval package to download one station with station_flow script in riverbeta
test_2 - TRY WITH OTHER STATION IDS TO SEE IF COLUMN NAMES ARE CONSISTENT TO DETERMINE IF PLOTTING FUNCTION CAN BE GENERIC.
       - ADJUST STATION_FLOW.R TO HANDLE MORE THAN ONE STATIONS AND PUT THEM INTO A TIDYTABLE FOR RETURN().
       - PERHAPS: HAVE THE FIELDS THAT USERS CHOOSE ON THE LEFT, THEN REPORT TABLE. SORT BY SOMETHING DEFAULT LIKE CLASS CHOSEN IF APPLICABLE AND/OR CURRENT FLOW SUITABILITY.
        THEN WHEN YOU HOVER OVER "SHOW ME FLOW" COLUMN FOR A RUN, A LITTLE WINDOW POPS UP WITH A PREVIEW PLOT OF THE FLOW.
        THEN IF YOU CLICK ON IT, IT GOES STRAIGHT TO A PAGE WITH A BIG PLOT OF THE FLOW, AND A WEATHER REPORT FROM THE NWS FOR THE PUTIN.
        PERHAPS ALSO HAVE A COLUMN WITH A PREDICTION OF HOW LIKELY IT WILL REMAIN WITHIN THE OPTIMAL FLOW WINDOW IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS. ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD REQUIRE A FLOW RESPONSE STATISTICAL MODEL DEVELOPED USING RAIN OBSERVED IN PAST/ PREDICTED FOR FUTURE.
        IT WOULD BE AWESOME TO CHOSE MAP VIEW AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE TABLE VIEW, THEN COLOR CODE EACH RUN BASED ON CURRENT OPTIMAL FLOW SUITABILITY. THEN IF YOU CHOOSE A DAY IN THE FUTURE, THE BORDERS OF THE RUN WOULD BE FUZZY PROPORTIONAL TO UNCERTAINTY IN FLOW PREDICTION?
